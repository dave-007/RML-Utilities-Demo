# RML-Utilities-Demo

These files support a recent presentation to South Florida SQL Server User Group on 2015-05-20.
I reviewed the RML Utilities (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/944837/) with background
on the tools, the process of creating a baseline from production SQL workload, replaying 
that workload to a test environment, and comparing the results.

The 'Performance Analysis Comparison Script.sql' script is my addition to the amazing RML Utilities toolset.
I found using the included reports limiting, and wanted results for all the sql batches compared by all available metrics
in the Performance Analysis database generated by the readtrace tool.
